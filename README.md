- ### **Git Commands to Initialize and Push Code to Repository**
To get started with version control, follow these Git commands to set up a new Git repository and push your code to Azure DevOps.

```
# Initialize a new Git repository in your local project
git init

# Link your local repository to the remote repository on Azure DevOps
git remote add origin <your_remote_api_git_url>

# Fetch the latest information from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Create a new branch named 'main' and switch to it
git checkout -b main

# Stage all changes in your local project for the next commit
git add .

# Commit the staged changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push the 'main' branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin main
```

## Git Commands Explanation
    git init
    Initializes a new Git repository in your local project directory.

    git remote add origin <URL>
    Links your local Git repository to a remote repository. In this case, it connects to the Azure DevOps repository.

    git fetch origin
    Fetches updates from the remote repository without merging them into your local branch.

    git checkout -b main
    Creates a new branch named main and switches to it. This step aligns your local branch naming with the remote repository's naming convention.

    git add .
    Stages all the changes you've made in your local repository for the next commit.

    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    Commits the staged changes to the local repository with a descriptive message.

    git push -u origin main
    Pushes the main branch to the remote repository and sets it as the default upstream branch for future pushes/pulls.

# Smartcertify UI Setup

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
